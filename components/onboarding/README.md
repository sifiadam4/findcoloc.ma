# Onboarding System Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides a complete user onboarding system that saves user data to the database and sets `isProfileCompleted` to true upon completion.

## Features

- ✅ Multi-step onboarding wizard with 3 steps
- ✅ Database integration with Prisma
- ✅ File upload support with Cloudinary
- ✅ Server actions for data persistence
- ✅ Toast notifications for user feedback
- ✅ Profile completion middleware
- ✅ Form validation with Zod
- ✅ Responsive UI components

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Schema

The `User` model includes:

- `isProfileComplete: Boolean @default(false)` - Main flag for profile completion
- All onboarding fields (name, phone, preferences, etc.)
- Related models for ID verification (`IdCard`, `Passport`)

### 2. Server Action (`actions/user.js`)

- `updateUserProfile(data)` - Main function to save user data
- Handles file uploads to Cloudinary
- Updates `isProfileComplete` to `true`
- Uses database transactions for data integrity

### 3. API Route (`app/api/user/profile/route.js`)

- Alternative REST API endpoint for profile updates
- Same functionality as server action
- Follows Next.js API route conventions

### 4. Onboarding Components

#### OnboardingWizard

- Main component managing the 3-step flow
- Uses server action for data submission
- Includes loading states and error handling
- Toast notifications for user feedback

#### Steps:

1. **BasicInfoStep** - Personal information
2. **PreferencesStep** - Roommate preferences
3. **VerificationStep** - Identity verification with file uploads

### 5. Middleware Protection

- Redirects incomplete profiles to `/onboarding`
- Redirects completed profiles away from onboarding
- Checks profile status on protected routes

### 6. File Upload System

- Base64 conversion for Cloudinary upload
- File validation (size, type)
- Preview functionality
- Secure storage with organized folder structure

## Usage

### Environment Variables Required

```env
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

### Profile Completion Check

```javascript
import { checkProfileCompletion } from "@/lib/check-profile";

const status = await checkProfileCompletion(userId);
// Returns: { isComplete: boolean, hasBasicInfo: boolean, user: object }
```

### Manual Profile Update

```javascript
import { updateUserProfile } from "@/actions/user";

const result = await updateUserProfile({
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john@example.com",
  // ... other fields
});
```

## Data Flow

1. User fills out onboarding steps
2. Data is collected in wizard state
3. On final submission:
   - Files are converted to base64
   - Server action processes the data
   - Files uploaded to Cloudinary
   - User record updated in database
   - `isProfileComplete` set to `true`
   - User redirected to dashboard

## Error Handling

- Form validation with Zod schemas
- File upload error handling
- Database transaction rollback on errors
- User-friendly toast notifications
- Loading states during submission

## Security Features

- File type and size validation
- Secure Cloudinary upload
- Server-side authentication checks
- Protected route middleware
- Input sanitization and validation

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Ensure environment variables are set
2. Start the development server
3. Navigate to `/onboarding` as a logged-in user
4. Complete all three steps
5. Verify profile completion in database
6. Check redirection to dashboard

## Future Enhancements

- Email verification integration
- Phone number verification
- Advanced file upload progress
- Drag & drop file upload
- Multiple file formats support
- Profile completion analytics
